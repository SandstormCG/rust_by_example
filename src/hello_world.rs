/* 
* This is another type of comment, a block comment. In general,
* line comments are the recommended comment style. But
* block comments are extremely useful for temporarily disabling
* chunks of code. /* Block comments can be /* nested, */ */
* so it takes only a few keystrokes to comment out everything
* in this main() function. /*/*/* Try it yourself! */*/*/
*/

/*
Note: The previous column of `*` was entirely for style. There's
no actual need for it.
